# DivvyBikePredictions

## Contributors: Neelu Nerella and Kathleen Melonashi

## Steps:
1. Got the data from the Divvy website: [Divvy.com/data ](https://divvybikes.com/system-data) and worked on cleaning the data until we ended up with a data frame that included the starting station, the hour the bike/scooter was checked out, and the number of bikes/scooters that were checked out for that hour at that station.
2. Worked on creating the Machine Learning models: Decision Tree Regression, Linear Regression, SVM, and KNN.
3. Finally worked on creating the loss curves for each model and printing out the accuracies for each model.
